## Client Portal for the Nevada Corporate Headquarters interview
During my first interview Melissa (I hope I'm spelling her name right) mentioned the first project would be a client portal for the https://nchinc.com website. So being the over achiever I am I decided to create a very basic client portal with documents and form views while consuming an api. There's also a few tests as well to show I mean well by testing but I'm not that great at it.
-Built with Laravel 6 (I believe this is the version you're using)
-Laravel bootstrap auth
-Todos is consumed through an api

## To get this running
I included the sql dump
login is email: bryansiegel@gmail.com
password is password
You can of course migrate the database yourself and use laravel tinker to add the user as well.
